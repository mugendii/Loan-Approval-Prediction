# Loan-Approval-Prediction
In this Project we will Demonstrate how to Predict Loan eligibility using Python and its Machine Learning Modules.
Predicting loan eligibility is a crucial part of the banking and finance sector. It is used by financial institutions, especially banks, to determine whether to approve a loan application.
A number of variables are taken into consideration, including the applicant's income, credit history, loan amount, education, and employment situation.
